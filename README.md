WebdriverIO Sublime Text 2/3 bundle
===================================

This is a package for [Sublime Text 2 & 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) that provides autocompletion
for all [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io/) action and protocol commands. It makes writing integration
test with WebdriverIO a breeze.

# Installation

1. Open Package Control: `Preferences -> Package Control`
2. Select Package Control: `Install Package`
3. Type `WebdriverIO` into the search box and select the package to install it

# Usage

Currently this plugin only provides autocompletion. Just type the first letters of a command and
Sublime Text will offer all WebdriverIO matching that pattern. E.g. initializing a Selenium session
with WebdriverIO:

Or when using different commands:

__Note:__ WebdriverIO has a lot (I mean really a looot) commands. So it might be that this plugin
blows up your autocompletion window which can be annoying if you have other autocompletion plugins.

There will be more features comming. Feature requests or even pull requests are much appriciated.

# Contributing

Don't modify any sublime-snippets as they get compiled from the WebdriverIO project the same way
like the [API documentation](http://webdriver.io/api.html) gets generated by [wddoc](https://github.com/webdriverio/wddoc).
If you find an error in one of the command description head over to the [WebdriverIO repository](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio)
and change the documentation of a specific command. If you want to change the way how the snippets gets
generated checkout [wddoc](https://github.com/webdriverio/wddoc) and especially the [template](https://github.com/webdriverio/wddoc/blob/master/templates/sublime-snippet.ejs)
that is responsible for the structure of these snippet files.
